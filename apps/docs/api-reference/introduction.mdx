## Welcome

## How to use the API
There are two main options to use the API:
1. You can send an header called `auth` with the token you received when you logged in.
2. You can send a cookie called `auth` with the token you received when you logged in.

The dashboard mainly uses the cookie method to authenticate requests.<br />
But if you want to test the API with Swagger or Postman, you can use the `auth` header.
