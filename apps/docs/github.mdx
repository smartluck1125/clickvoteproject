To use GitHub open settings of either your profile or and organization and click on "Developers Settings".
And it left menu, click on "oAuth Apps" and then "New oAuth App".

In the `Authorization callback URL` add `http://localhost:4200/settings`<br />
Then copy the GitHub `Client ID` and `Client Secret` and paste them in the `.env` file.

```env
GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=""
