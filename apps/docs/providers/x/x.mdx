X is a bit different.<br />
They created an oAuth2 flow, but it works only with Twitter v2 API.<br />
But in order to upload pictures to X, you need to use the old Twitter v1 API.<br />
So we are going to use the normal oAuth1 flow for that (that supports Twitter v2 also ü§∑üèª‚Äç).<br /><br />

Head over the [Twitter developers page](https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/dashboard) and create a new app.<br />

In the App Permission set it to `Read and Write`
In the Type of App set it to `Web App, Automated App or Bot`
In the App Info set the `Callback URI / Redirect URL` to `http://localhost:4200/integrations/social/x`
Save it and go to "Keys and Tokens" tab

Click on "Regenerate" inside "Consumer Keys" and copy the `API Key` and `API Key Secret`.
Open .env file and add the following:
