It is important to have the special permissions or you will not have the ability to refresh your tokens.

Make sure your redirect URL is set to `http://localhost:4200/integrations/social/linkedin` for local development.
Copy the created `Client ID` and `Client Secret` and add them to your `.env` file.

```env
LINKEDIN_CLIENT_ID=""
LINKEDIN_CLIENT_SECRET=""
```
